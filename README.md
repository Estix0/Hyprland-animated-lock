This script is designed to run **mpv** while **hyprlock** is active. It was originally intended to be used with converted Plymouth animations found [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/plymouth-themes) and converted with **convert.sh** found in utils.

### Installation and Usage

The main script, **Hyprlock-animated.sh**, is responsible for running **mpv** alongside **hyprlock**. It points to an **output.webm** file generated by the **convert.sh** script located in the `utils` folder.

#### Customizing the Animation

To use your own animation, modify the path in **Hyprlock-animated.sh** to point to your desired video file.

### Hyprlock Configuration

For **Hyprlock** to work properly, you **must** remove any background from your **hyprlock** configuration. A working file (**hyprlock.conf**) is provided in the `utils` folder if you don't feel like making it yourself.
